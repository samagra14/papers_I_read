However, when I started reading papers, I was constantly trying to absorb as much information as possible. I am a compulsive note taker and that made matters worse. And so, I took to the online academic community to seek help. I came across multiple approaches aimed at easing the paper reading ritual. Of all the approaches, the one that appears repeatedly is the three pass approach. This approach has been recommended by people from a lot of different academic communities. (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-you-should-read-research-papers-according-to-andrew-ng-stanford-deep-learning-lectures-98ecbd3ccfb3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ML</a>, <a href="https://sosp19.rcs.uwaterloo.ca/diversity/slides/rebecca.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Systems</a> etc) <strong>I have extracted the below information from <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the article written by S. Keshav</a>. </strong></p><p>The key idea is that instead of reading your paper from start to end in one go, you should read the paper in upto three passes.</p><ul><li>The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper.</li><li>The second pass lets you grasp the paper's content but not the details</li><li>The third pass is a full depth review of the paper.</li></ul><h2>The first pass</h2><p>This pass is just a casual scan of the paper to decide whether it will be a useful addition to your knowledge. This should not take more than <strong>10 minutes</strong>. While going through the first pass:</p><ol><li>Go through the title, abstract and introduction</li><li>Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else</li><li>Read the conclusions</li></ol><p>The goal should be to answer the five Cs:</p><ol><li><strong>Category</strong> (the kind of paper): Systems/ Theory/ Analysis/ Prototype/ SoTA improvement/ Defining a new problem/ A dataset paper</li><li><strong>Context</strong> : Other papers related to this, the general research area. Assumptions and theoretical/empirical basis</li><li><strong>Correctness</strong>: Are the assumptions valid? Is the problem well defined and worth solving?</li><li><strong>Contributions</strong>: What does the research community gain from this? Is it a new algorithm, a new dataset, a new network architecture, a new pre-task etc?</li><li><strong>Clarity</strong>: Is the paper well-written? In essence, after the past pass do you have an idea of how you would approach the problem.</li></ol><p>After the first pass, decide if you wish to continue with the paper. The paper might not be of your interest at the moment or might not be relevant to you at all. Even while writing the papers, it is usually good to lay out the above Cs in detail in your introduction section.</p><h2>The second pass</h2><p>In the second pass you have to go through the entire paper with greater care. You can ignore laborious details such as proofs and appendices. The second pass should take you <strong>about an hour.</strong></p><ol><li>Look carefully at the diagrams. For each diagram write a key insight that the diagram contributes to the entire paper. Perform <strong>WALTER</strong> (Why, Axes, Lines, Trends, Exceptions, Recap) for the graphs. Check statistical significance etc.</li><li>Add relevant references to your reading lists for a later look.</li></ol><p>After the second pass, you should be in a state to explain the paper to a third person along with all the assumptions, graphs, diagrams, experimental methodology and theoretical basis. This level of readiness is sufficient for the papers which are orthogonal or even slightly tangential to your research area. Again, while writing papers, the details mentioned in point 1 should be relevant.</p><h2>The third pass</h2><p>You should proceed to the third pass only if knowing the ins and outs of the paper will directly impact your current research work. This pass can take anywhere from <strong>3 hours to an entire day</strong>. You have to try to virtually reimplement the paper. After each paragraph you should ask why this paragraph and play an adversary to falsify the claims made in the paragraph. </p><p>At the end of the paper, write down the strong and weak points of the paper. Present solutions to the weaker details, pinpoint missing citations to relevant work and reconstruct the structure from memory.</p><p>I have tried my best to stick to this paradigm for a while but the third pass becomes a bit tedious for me. Initially, the third pass might take longer but as you gain experience and knowledge in the particular area, your speed also increases. I am still not at that stage but I try to stick to the schedule of a paper every weekend. Lately, I have been having problems being faithful and hence, I am making the entire process public with the hope that a public account might keep me on schedule.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 31, 2020</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><img class="bio__avatar" src="./media/website/prof_pic.png" loading="lazy" alt="Samagra Sharma"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="./authors/samagra-sharma/" class="invert" rel="author">Samagra Sharma</a></h3><p>Samagra is an AI Researcher at Adobe Media and Data Science Research Labs.
